### Project
Binance Crypto Trading Bot - Boolinger Bands Strategy
### Main Goal
The main goal of this project  was to develop a back test enviroment in python to deploy a crypto trading bot using the Binance API to gather crypto's historical data. The created environment allows simultaneous analysis of different digital assests traded on Binance, testing different trading strategies, and visualizing the trade data on graphs. This, gives a rough estimate if a trading strategy would be profitable in a similar live trading bot.
###Data

### Bollinger Bounce Strategy
The Boolinger Bands are a technical indicator developed by John Bollinger and are used to indentify "overbought" and "oversold conditions.
Most stock charting applications use a 20-period moving average for the default settings and the upper and lower bands are then a measure of volatility to the upside and downside. They are calculated as two standard deviations from the middle band.
